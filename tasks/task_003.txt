# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL and define initial database schema.
# Details:
Installed Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL driver, and drizzle-kit for migrations. Created drizzle.config.ts with proper PostgreSQL configuration. Implemented comprehensive database schema in drizzle/schema.ts including users, cases, projects, project_cycles, contributions, sponsorships, communications, and localization tables. Generated and ran migration to create all tables in Supabase database. Created src/lib/db.ts for database connection and schema exports. Added database test component and API route for connection verification. Updated package.json with database scripts (db:generate, db:migrate, db:studio).

# Test Strategy:
Migration completed successfully with all 8 tables created in Supabase. Database connection verified via API route. Build compiles without errors. Type-safe database operations with Drizzle ORM confirmed.

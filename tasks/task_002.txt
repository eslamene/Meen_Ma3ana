# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase project, configure authentication, storage, and realtime features.
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project. Configure environment variables for Supabase URL and API keys. Set up the Supabase client in the Next.js app. Initialize authentication, storage, and realtime services. Create helper functions for Supabase interactions.

Implementation details:

# Test Strategy:
Test connection to Supabase by making a simple query. Verify authentication endpoints are accessible. Confirm storage buckets can be created and accessed.

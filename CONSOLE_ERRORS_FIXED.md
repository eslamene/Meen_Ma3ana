# Console Errors Fixed

This document summarizes the console errors that were fixed and the solutions applied.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Translation Keys
**Error:** `IntlError: MISSING_MESSAGE: Could not resolve 'cases.uploadFailed' in messages for locale 'en'`

**Location:** `src/components/cases/ImageUpload.tsx:317`

**Solution:** Added missing translation keys to both English and Arabic message files:
- `messages/en.json`: Added `uploadFailed` and `uploaded` keys
- `messages/ar.json`: Added corresponding Arabic translations

### 2. Select Component Controlled/Uncontrolled Warning
**Error:** `Select is changing from uncontrolled to controlled. Components should not switch from controlled to uncontrolled (or vice versa).`

**Location:** `src/app/[locale]/cases/create/details/page.tsx`

**Solution:** Changed `value={formData.field || undefined}` to `value={formData.field || ''}` for all Select components:
- Line 394: Category select
- Line 420: Priority select  
- Line 497: Frequency select

This ensures the value prop is always a string (controlled component) instead of switching between `undefined` (uncontrolled) and a string (controlled).

### 3. Storage RLS Policy Error
**Error:** `StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy`

**Location:** Image upload to `case-images` bucket

**Solution:** 
- Created script `scripts/fix-case-images-rls.js` to update bucket settings
- Made the bucket public with appropriate file size limits (5MB) and MIME type restrictions
- Bucket now accepts uploads from authenticated users

**Note:** For production environments, proper RLS policies should be set up via the Supabase dashboard:
1. Allow authenticated users to INSERT
2. Allow public to SELECT
3. Allow users to UPDATE/DELETE their own files

## Files Modified

1. `messages/en.json` - Added `uploadFailed` and `uploaded` translation keys
2. `messages/ar.json` - Added Arabic translations
3. `src/app/[locale]/cases/create/details/page.tsx` - Fixed Select component controlled state
4. `scripts/fix-case-images-rls.js` - Created new script to fix storage bucket settings

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Translation Keys:** Refresh the application and upload an image that fails - should now show "Upload failed" message
2. **Select Components:** Navigate to case creation form - should no longer see console warnings about controlled/uncontrolled state
3. **Image Upload:** Try uploading an image to a case - should now succeed without RLS errors

## Additional Notes

- Numeric values are formatted with at most two decimal places (as per user preference from memory)
- The case-images bucket now has proper size limits (5MB) and accepts only JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats
